Introduction
Note:

'Auditors' and 'Security Researchers' will be used interchangeably.
'Audit' and 'engagement' will be used interchangeably.
For Spearbit’s community of security researchers and the general web3 security ecosystem to thrive, it is key to acknowledge and support auditors’ growth during their professional career. Therefore, it is our responsibility that we clearly document and clarify the promotion process flow in an effort to encourage auditors career pursuits in alignment with what we consider to be the required skill set for each step of their professional development according to Spearbit’s role design.

The onboarding process must change in order to accomodate for the requirements found under each described role. The onboarding process must test each applicant's knowledge on a variety of blockchain related fields to fit a role.

The readers of this document are encouraged to leave feedback and suggestions.


About Promotions
It is not obvious how a fair and transparent promotion process must work within a security DAO when the risk of promoting someone without the adequate skill can result in harm being done to third parties in the industry and therefore, Spearbits' reputation.

Instead of driving and micromanaging each step the applicant is subject to, the core team should have minimum involvement.

It is therefore the intention to design a fair and quasi-automated process which satisfies applicant demands yet still complies with Spearbits' quality control mechanisms and expectations.

When companies and projects are hiring for developers, security consultants and security engineers (i.e. auditors) they take into consideration the credentials of these individuals and teams of experts. In regards to Spearbit, these credentials preceded our reputation, and allow for the opportunity of working with top tier projects to assist in improving their security posture.

For this reason, Spearbit cannot take an internal promotion process lightly knowing that such credentials carry reputational weight and will be accepted across the web3 industry as the new standard.

The fairest way to approach promotions is by making it as easy as possible for others to evaluate someone else's skill set and expertise.


Spearbit Roles
Auditors in the Spearbit community have a wide range of experience and skill sets. Roles are applied based on an individual’s verifiable track record, this includes both technical and soft skills. These are mostly evaluated during the cultural and technical interview process while complementary data is collected from each engagement performance, social media profiles, references, contributions to the space, etc.

Auditors engaging in Spearbit audits are compensated according to their role within the community. Currently, the following formalized roles that exist are Junior Security Researcher (JSR), Associate Security Researcher (ASR), Security Researcher (SR) and Lead Security Researcher (LSR).

It must be noted that a standardized, industry wide definition for each one of the abovementioned roles does not exist yet, and it is purely based on resume. Therefore, one of the secondary objectives of this document is to define and measure each one of the roles to standardize them.

We proceed to define and describe each role as follows.

Promotion Flow


The above diagram shows the promotion process from a high level perspective including several components which are described down below:

Spearbit auditors portfolio. The best way to evaluate auditors expertise is by having them craft their own web3 security portfolio.

Applicants can maintain and submit a free format portfolio with content that should include:

A summary of all Spearbit audits you have been on, including all issues you have found during the audit, your assessment of the quality of the audit and the risks of the protocol, and the names of the auditors (APR's, SR's & LSRs) that were on the audit.
A summary (and detail when possible) of all Security work you have done since your Spearbit onboarding. This can be other web3 audits you've done outside of Spearbit, and web2 security consulting as well.
A summary of why you think you should be promoted to the next level- emphasis on technical AND soft skills.
We aim to introduce it as a means of reducing evaluators cognitive load during assessment time. An updated portfolio also has multiple benefits for the person creating it. Therefore, we believe this method is beneficial to everyone, both regarding promotions and on a personal / professional level.


SEAL engagements. A classic, collaborative Spearbit audit led by LSRs who pose questions and challenges during the audit in order to test and evaluate Junior Security Researchers and Associate Security Researchers skills.

Performance is measured subjectively. See example of table below:



SEALs are introduced as Spearbit's response to the need of upskilling Junior Security Researchers into Security Researchers by offering guided audits.

Participating in SEAL engagements require that the average Junior Security Researcher and Associate Security Researcher rate of 3k/week and 6,25k /week must be lowered in order to fit the clients budget.


SEAL-X engagement: Competitive, individual audit where auditors try to find the maximum amount of issues on their own using different tools and resources. Issues are submitted to SRs and LSRs for reviewing and objective evaluation.

See an example of an evaluation template below.




LSR council. For Security Researchers to become LSRs, 3/5 LSRs + 2 core team members must vote in favour of the applicant. A Spearbit portfolio must also be submitted for evaluation.


Junior Security Researcher to Associate Security Researcher
Fixed Requirements:

Participated in minimum 3 Spearbit audits.
Must submit a portfolio.
Can apply once per quarter.


Junior Security Researcher submits portfolio proving he has reached an Associate Security Researcher level after 3 Spearbit audits.

The Spearbit core team will evaluate such portfolio with the help of an SR and LSR. If the applicant's portfolio proves notable experience in blockchain security over that of a Junior Security Researcher, a new freelance contract applying the new rate and highlighting new responsibilities will be sent for the applicant to sign.

Responsibilities at this level include those of an Junior Security Researcher plus client bug fix reviews.


Associate Security Researcher to Security Researcher
A notable skill gap exists between Junior Security Researchers / Associate Security Researchers and Security Researchers. It is imperative that skills and knowledge are evaluated as objectively as possible.

Participated in minimum 5 Spearbit audits.
Must submit portfolio.
Must have participated in 3 SEALs.
Can apply once per quarter.



Security Researcher to Lead Security Researcher
Evaluating a Security Researcher's skills is a hard task. It is therefore that part of this process is directly outsourced to LSRs who must vote in favour or against an applicant's promotion request.

Participated in minimum 9 Spearbit audits.
Must submit a portfolio.
Can apply once per quarter.


A council of LSRs (preferably made out of those who have previously participated in audits with the applicant) will review the applicants portfolio, track record, skillset, etc.., and will reach a decision if the applicant is ready to perform as, and take the same responsibilities a Lead Security Researcher has.


FAQs
Why can someone automatically become an SR/LSR after onboarding?
Because of a provable track record.

Why do i need "X" Spearbit audits to prove my worth?
To build a provable track record and gather data.

What happens if my appliaction is denied?
You can apply every quarter.
